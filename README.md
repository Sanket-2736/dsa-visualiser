# 📊 DSA Visualizer

An interactive **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Visualizer** built with **React.js**.  
This project helps students and developers understand how various **data structures** and **algorithms** work through step-by-step visualizations.

## 🚀 Features

### 🏗️ Data Structures

* **Queue** → Enqueue and Dequeue operations with animations.
* **Stack** → Push and Pop operations visualized.
* **Linked List** → Node insertion, deletion, and traversal.
* **HashMap** → Hashing, collisions, and storage representation.
* **Binary Tree** → Dynamic insertion and tree traversal.
* **AVL Tree** → Self-balancing tree with automatic **rotations**.
* **Graph** → Graph creation and representation.

### 🔢 Algorithms

* **Bubble Sort** → Step-by-step comparison and swapping.
* **Insertion Sort** → Element shifting visualized.
* **Merge Sort** → Divide-and-conquer process animation.
* **Binary Search** → Search process across a sorted array.
* **Tower of Hanoi** → Recursive moves of disks between rods.
* **N-Queens Problem** → Backtracking visualization of queens placement.

### 📈 Graph Algorithms

* **Prim’s Algorithm** → Minimum Spanning Tree construction.
* **Kruskal’s Algorithm** → Edge selection and cycle detection visualization.
